NVIDIA Tegra audio complex, with MAX98090 CODEC

Required properties:
- compatible : "nvidia,tegra-audio-max98090"
- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names : Must include the following entries:
  "pll_a" (The Tegra clock of that name),
  "pll_a_out0" (The Tegra clock of that name),
  "mclk" (The Tegra cdev1/extern1 clock, which feeds the CODEC's mclk)
- nvidia,model : The user-visible name of this sound complex.
- nvidia,audio-routing : A list of the connections between audio components.
  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink,
  the second being the connection's source. Valid names for sources and
  sinks are the MAX98090's pins, and the jacks on the board.

  Board connectors:

  * Headphones
  * Speakers
  * Mic Jack

- nvidia,i2s-controller : The phandle of the Tegra I2S controller that's
  connected to the CODEC.
- nvidia,audio-codec : The phandle of the MAX98090 audio codec. This binding
  assumes that AIF1 on the CODEC is connected to Tegra.

Optional properties:
- nvidia,hp-det-gpios : The GPIO that detects headphones are plugged in
- nvidia,mic-det-gpios : The GPIO that detects if an external mic is plugged in

Example:

  sound {
    compatible = "nvidia,tegra-audio-max98090-venice2",
           "nvidia,tegra-audio-max98090";
    nvidia,model = "NVIDIA Tegra Venice2";

    nvidia,audio-routing =
      "Headphones", "HPR",
      "Headphones", "HPL",
      "Speakers", "SPKR",
      "Speakers", "SPKL";

    nvidia,i2s-controller = <&tegra_i2s1>;
    nvidia,audio-codec = <&max98090>;

    clocks = <&tegra_car 216>, <&tegra_car 217>, <&tegra_car 120>;
    clock-names = "pll_a", "pll_a_out0", "mclk";
  };
